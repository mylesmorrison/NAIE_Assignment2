Question 4. 1 (30/100)
Consider the 6 sorting algorithms you have learnt: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge
Sort, Heap Sort and Quick Sort. Explain which sorting algorithm(s) is suitable for the three different
scenarios of input data given below. The data is:
1. In random order (i.e., you have no information about the order of the elements)
2. In a nearly sorted order (i.e., only a maximum of 1 or 2 elements are disordered)
3. In reversed order than your expected sorting order (e.g., if your expected order is: 2, 4, 7, 9, 15
The given data is in the reversed order as 15, 9, 7, 4, 2)
You should provide an explanation for the three different scenarios 1, 2, 3 separately (you may take up
to 150-300 words per scenario.). Your explanation should include, why your chosen sorting algorithm(s)
is suitable for the given scenario over the other sorting algorithms. You may use this tool to compare the
different sorting algorithms you have learnt
