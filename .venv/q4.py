Question 4. 1 (30/100)
Consider the 6 sorting algorithms you have learnt: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge
Sort, Heap Sort and Quick Sort. Explain which sorting algorithm(s) is suitable for the three different
scenarios of input data given below. The data is:
1. In random order (i.e., you have no information about the order of the elements)
2. In a nearly sorted order (i.e., only a maximum of 1 or 2 elements are disordered)
3. In reversed order than your expected sorting order (e.g., if your expected order is: 2, 4, 7, 9, 15
The given data is in the reversed order as 15, 9, 7, 4, 2)
You should provide an explanation for the three different scenarios 1, 2, 3 separately (you may take up
to 150-300 words per scenario.). Your explanation should include, why your chosen sorting algorithm(s)
is suitable for the given scenario over the other sorting algorithms. You may use this tool to compare the
different sorting algorithms you have learnt

Question 4. 2 (70/100)
4. a. Implement the Merge sort algorithm in python to sort a list with “K” elements in the descending
order (decreasing order). You may consider that all “K” elements in the list are integers. You should
write a function “merge_sort” that takes a python list as a parameter and returns a list that is sorted
in the descending order. You are free to write other functions to help with your merge sort
implementation.
Example of the function behavior:
Calling the function:
merge_sort([2, 8, 10, 1, 5, 3, 7, 9, 12, 90])
Function output:
[90, 12, 10, 9, 8, 7, 5, 3, 2, 1]

b. Draw the Merge sort tree for the above example

"""
5. Answer the following questions based on the Merge Sort algorithm
a. Merge sort belongs to the category of Divide and Conquer algorithm design. Explain the Merge
Sort algorithm with respect to the Divide and Conquer algorithm design paradigm (100 - 250
words)
(10 points)
b. Compare and contrast the Merge sort algorithm with another Divide and Conquer sorting
algorithm you have learnt (100 – 250 words).
